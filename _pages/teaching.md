In my role as Digital Humanities Technology Specialist at FSU's RCC, I have had the great luck to do a number of workshops for multiple departments. 

In addition to the workshops and in-class lectures, I am currently teaching  a 6-week __Intro to CS with Python__  for high school students.

The table below contains all the workshops/ lectures we have done at RCC over the last year. If it was an in-class lecture the respective faculty member is also included.
