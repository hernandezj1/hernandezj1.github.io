In my MA and my professional development at the Research Computing Center at FSU, I have come into contact with many different technologies and professional organizations. Here I list the technologies that I use regularly and the organizations I am a part of not only as proof of content but as a personal knowledge base to keep all my resources in a single space. 
Please feel free to use any of the links here provided for your own benefit or ask if you are interested in any of the topics stated below. I may not have the answer but we can find it together!
