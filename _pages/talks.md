In my MA and my professional development at RCC I have come into contact with many different technologies and professional orgaizations. Here I list the technologies that i use regularly and the organizations I am a part of not only as proof of content but as a personal knowledge base to keep all my resources in a single space. 
Please feel free to use any of the links here provided for your own benefit or ask if you are interested in any of the topics stated below. I may not have the answer but we can find it together!
I have separated  the content into 4 topical areas for ease of navigation. 

Each section follows the conventions: 
  - __certifications__
  - _professional affiliations_
  - Technological competencies

#### Digital Humanities 


#### Python


#### Additional Programming Knowledge


#### Quantum work
