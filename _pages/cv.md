Education
======

For my undergraduate and MA degree, I went to the University of Chicago, where I graduated with a BA in History and an MA in Digital Studies of Language, Culture, and History. For my bachelors work I produced the following website:

Here I utilized the _Mapbox Storytelling_ platform to argue for the inclusion of the Mongol campigans of the 13thcentury as examples of operational art by military historians. to do this I visually represented through the use of maps and statistics both the Mongol invasion of eastern Europe and the Franco-Austrian War of 1809.

For my master's work, I utilized  __citation networks__ to study the influence of Central Asian military knowledge on the development of operational art in Russian and American militaries of the 19th and 20th centuries.
